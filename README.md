# Bouncin Balls Java

My first Java game, Bouncen Balls is a simple game where the objective is to get your red ball
to the green one while avoiding the blue ones. Each time you reach the green ball you get one
point and a new blue ball is added. It features both a local and global high-score table, however
the global high-score table sever has been down for a long time.
